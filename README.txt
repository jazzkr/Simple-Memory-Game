This is a simple memory game that I developed during my spare time in a computer science class in high school. It used to have a high scores system that used a MySQL database to keep the scores but the server has since then gone down. It shows random generation and GUI programming in Java. Unfortunately the original source code could not be found so a tool had to be used to generate the code from the class files.
